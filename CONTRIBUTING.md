## How to Contribute

### Did you want to add a new PyTrick?

- **Ensure the issue has not already been added** by looking through the [`PyTricks`](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/tree/main/PyTricks) folder on GitHub.
- If you are unable to find the PyTrick, create a new `.py` file with the verbatim text from the PyTrick email.
- Then create a new PyTrick on the website in the [`gh-pages`](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/tree/gh-pages) branch.
- Finally, update the [README Table of Contents](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive#table-of-contents) with links to the `.py` and Web versions of the PyTrick.

### Did you find a bug?

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/issues).
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
- Use the issue templates to create the issue. They include step by step guidelines and have lists of things that should be included.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or updates the documentation?

- Open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/pulls) on GitHub with the patch.
- Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Be sure to include a **title**, and as much relevant information as possible. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?

- Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of the PyTricks Archive are still accepted! Just follow the same instructions as above.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- **Ensure the feature was not already introduced** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/issues). Look for those under the [enhancement](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement) tag.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the new feature, [open a new one](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/issues/new)!

### Do you have questions about the source code?

- Ask any question about how to use Maximum PC Builds Archive on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/peAUPyCCuw).
- If it does not get answered, open an [issue](https://github.com/willtheorangeguy/PyTricks-Archive/issues/new).
